# GoGreen Laboratory Database

This project contains the SQL schema and complex queries for the **GoGreen Laboratory** system. It simulates a real-world laboratory database used for managing test orders, clients, results, and staff operations. The database is designed using Microsoft SQL Server and includes demo queries for showcasing advanced SQL functionality.

---

## 🏗️ Project Structure

- `GoGreenLaboratory11_18_2023.sql`  
  Contains the full database schema (tables, relationships, constraints) and sample data for demonstration and testing.

- `GoGreenLaboratoryComplexQueries.sql`  
  Includes complex SQL queries that highlight multi-table joins, subqueries, aggregations, and case logic.

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Requirements

- Microsoft SQL Server (Express or Developer edition)
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

### 2. Setup Instructions

1. **Create a new database** in SSMS (e.g., `GoGreenLabDB`)
2. Open `GoGreenLaboratory11_18_2023.sql` in SSMS
3. Execute the script to create tables and insert data
4. (Optional) Run queries from `GoGreenLaboratoryComplexQueries.sql` in a new query window
